# explore
R package for simple and fast data exploration

Using the explore packate to explore data is as simple as "data %>% explore()"
This launches an interactive shiny-app that makes basic data exploration radically simple.

If you want to use the functionality of the explore package for reproducable data science, there are basically two "verbs" to remember:
* explore - if you want to explore a dataset or attributes or the relationship between attributes and a binary target
* describe - if you want to describe a dataset or attributs (number of na, unique values, ...)
